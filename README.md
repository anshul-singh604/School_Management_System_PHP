INTRODUCTION

1.1 School management system
School management system project is a project in which one can manage all the activities of a school. This project is useful for administration of a school college where user can manage school activities like manage students, manage teacher, manage result, manage fee etc. 

1.2 Objective of School management system
Some main points of my objectives of this management system.
Computerization – All the details regarding school, whether it is small or big, will be computerized.
No Redundant Data – As this management system will be centralized, the chances of the duplicate data in the system are close to nil.
Automation – The automation feature of this management system will mitigate the task of writing the papers. Ex- there is no need to write the report card of the students on the paper by the pen. It simply can be done online on the system and can be forwarded to the students and their parents.
Easy Interaction – In today’s rush hour of the life, it is difficult for a parent to go to the school of his / her child every time a teacher call.
By this management system, it will easier for a parent and a teacher to be in touch every day. As a matter of fact, it will be easier for each individual person who is associated with the system to be in touch as per needed.
